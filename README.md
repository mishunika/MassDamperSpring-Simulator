# Topic: Simulation of a Mass-Damper-Spring Simulator
## Intro

The purpose of this laboratory work is to simulate a damped harmonic simulator. The main problem was to represent mathematically the problem.
In fact we have to deal with a second-order differential equation. To solve this equation I used Euler's method.

When we have our differential equation solved, we can use the obtained data to plot it or to create a simple simulation.

The differential equation used is:
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2x%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D%20&plus;%20c%20%5Cfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D%20&plus;%20kx%20%3D%20F%28t%29) and as soon as we compute the x for the each moment of time, we're almost done with the serious mathematical computations.

## Prepairing
The process of prepairing for the lab was done in a team of: [Alexandra Pleșco](https://github.com/sashokparashok), [Eugen Ungureanu](https://github.com/Requiem-), [Sergiu Terman](https://github.com/xserjjx), [Vladimir Tribusean](https://github.com/vladutzik).
And as you warned us in the lab requirements, we had lot of fun. :smile:


## Coding
The program was written fully in python and I've used the numpy, matplotlib, pygame libraries in order to make things happen.

## Outro
At this laboratory work I had the opportunity to represent mathematically and to simulate a real mechanical process. It is very useful for us, as future engineers to be able to transpose the real-world processes in a mathematical domain in order to be able to make beautiful computations.

The main difficulty was to understand the mathematical problem and to learn how Euler's method works. The rest of the process was fun.
